# Overview

This is the relaunch of the new www.vim.org website. We have found a small team that will take on the i
beautiful task of rebuilding the website with current design and new concepts.

The new development should not take place behind closed doors, we want to 
make the new development public and transparent for you.

Soon there will be a test system where you can follow the current status successively.

Of course, we will involve you, the community, in the design by collecting ideas and feedback.


# Requirements

Add your requirements here:

## Functional Requirements

* The website should continue important components
  * User Accounts
  * Vim Scripts community space (Filing, Versioning, Search, ...)
  * Blog, Announcements
* Existing contents should be migrated

## Non-Functional Requirements

* We want to continue using MySQL 8 as the database system.
* We want the website to be fundamentally secure and avoid typical web application vulnerabilities (like SQL injection, XSS, ...) by design. 
* The hashing of the user passwords is to be migrated to a hashing procedure that corresponds to the state of the art.
* The frontend/backend stack shall:
  - should be maintainable and expandable in the future with reasonable effort
  - be opensource based
  - the components used should be vital
  - shall be efficient with server resources
